# Express Routing Lab

## Introduction

We've now seen how to write an app with Node and Express from scratch, so let's apply this concept again by creating another RESTful API using Express.

A kid has come to you with an idea for an API to keep track of his candies.  You love candies!  So, you accept his proposal. You will create a resource `Candy` and use the kid's candy "data" to populate and post to your database. Check the additional resources at the bottom of this document to get some JSON data to add to your app as well, as well as some cURL examples to make sure your app works as expected!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create an Express app from minimal starter code
- Use a local JS `array` of candy `object`s to mimic a database of candies
- This app will only respond to/with JSON; it is just an API, so don't worry about displaying HTML or files
- The resource `Candy` should be accessible via the endpoint `/candies` and be RESTful
- Implement `index`,`show`, `create`, `update`, and `destroy` functionality

**Bonus:**
- Handle wrong responses with appropriate HTTP status and responses (404, 500, 422)
- Add some validations for `create` and `update` to make sure our candies have a `name` and a `color`

#### Your candy "database"

We will soon create a fully functioning database, but for now we can use our tools from Unit 1 to fake a database.  We will do this by creating a `candies` array, and putting candy objects inside of it. To see how we would build this array, look below at our first expected API response, for `index`.

<!-- You should model up through index and create, including creation of the candies database -->

#### Deliverable

By the end of the lab, you should have an app with most, or all, of the 5 RESTful routes listed above.

Once you spin up your local server, open up Postman. Look below at the Postman commands, and try to get each of your 5 routes to match the expected responses. The HTTP status should always be 2XX.

`Index` Postman Request

- Method: GET
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/candies`

  - Expected Response
  `[{"id":1,"name":"Chewing Gum","color":"Red"},{"id":2,"name":"Pez","color":"Green"},{"id":3,"name":"Marshmallow","color":"Pink"},{"id":4,"name":"Candy Stick","color":"Blue"}]`

---

`Show` Postman Request

- Method: GET
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/candies/3`

  - Expected Response
  `{"id":3,"name":"Marshmallow","color":"Pink"}`

---

`Create` Postman Request

- Method: POST
- Header: "Content-Type: application/json"
- Body: `{"id": 5, "name":"Jelly Belly","color":"Orange"}`
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/candies`

  - Expected Response
    `{"id":5,"name":"Jelly Belly","color":"Orange"}`

---


- A second `Index` Postman Request

- Method: GET
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/candies`

  - Expected Response

  `[{"id":1,"name":"Chewing Gum","color":"Red"},{"id":2,"name":"Pez","color":"Green"},{"id":3,"name":"Marshmallow","color":"Pink"},{"id":4,"name":"Candy Stick","color":"Blue"},{"id": 5, "name":"Jelly Belly","color":"Orange"}]`
  > Note: The new record is sent back !

---

`Update` cURL Request

- Method: PUT
- Headers: "Content-Type: application/json"
- Body: `{"name":"Marshmallows","color":"white"}`
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/candies/3`

---

Another `Index` Request

- Method: GET
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/candies`

  - Expected Response

  `[{"id":1,"name":"Chewing Gum","color":"Red"},{"id":2,"name":"Pez","color":"Green"},{"name":"Marshmallows","color":"white"},{"id":4,"name":"Candy Stick","color":"Blue"}]`
  
  > Note: The record corresponding to the ID passed in the first request has been updated.

---

`Destroy` Postman Request

- Method: DELETE
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/candies/2`

  - Expected Response
    `{"message":"deleted"}`

---

`Index` Postman request, again!

- Method: GET
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/candies`

 - Expected Response

  `[{"id":1,"name":"Chewing Gum","color":"Red"},null,{"id":3,"name":"Marshmallow","color":"Pink"},{"id":4,"name":"Candy Stick","color":"Blue"}]`

> Note: The record corresponding to the ID passed in the first request has been deleted.
